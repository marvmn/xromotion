_E*x*pressive *Ro*bot *Motion* Framework_

A framework for combining task-oriented robot motion with expressive behavior.

## Features
- Animation Editor _(Create pre-recorded motion for a robot and play them back)_
- Motion Planning Integration _(MoveIt! integration allows task based motion planning)_
- Plan Composition _(Compose motion plans made from animations and motion planning tasks and execute them)_
- Expressive Transformations _(Modify existing trajectories to add expressive patterns)_

### Available Transformations
- Jitter _(Add shakiness to the robot)_
- Extent _(Make the robot take up more space with its pose and its movement)_
- Gaze _(Let a link of the robot point at a point in space)_

Video demonstrations of the effects are available [here](https://marvmn.github.io/bachelor-thesis-examples/)
